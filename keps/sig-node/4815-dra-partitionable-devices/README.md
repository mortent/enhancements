## Summary

One of the original use-cases for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was the
ability to dynamically allocate partitions of a full device (in addition to
the full device itself). Whereas the traditional device plugin API forces users
to statically partition devices ahead of time, DRA was designed to allow those
partitions to be created on demand. This leads to increased resource
utilization as the size of each partitioned device can be matched in real-time
to the workload requesting it.

As DRA has evolved from what we now call "classic" DRA to "structured
parameters" this ability to dynamically partition devices has been lost.
This KEP proposes a method to bring this capability back within the framework
that "structured parameters" provides. Additionally, it provides primitives to
represent both full devices and their partitions in a more compact way than is
possible today.

Note that the extensions proposed in this KEP are completely transparent to the
end-user. In 1.31, it is already possible to select a device partition via a
`ResourceClaim`, so long as the device vendor has pre-partitioned its devices
and advertised them as such inside  a `ResourceSlice`. The user-facing
mechanism to select these devices doesn't change with the extensions proposed
in this KEP. Instead, the proposed extensions provide the ability for a vendor
to advertise "overlapping" partitions, such that the scheduler will never
allocate conflicting ones at the same time. This, in turn, gives the vendor the
opportunity to dynamically create these partitions *after* they have been
allocated, rather than requiring them to be created before.

## Motivation

One of the primary motivating examples for supporting partitionable devices
with DRA is to enable the dynamic allocation of Multi-Instance GPUs
(MIG) on NVIDIA hardware. MIG devices are represented as fixed-size partitions
of a full GPU that consume a portion of its capacity across multiple
dimensions. These dimensions include things like number of JPEG engines, number
of multiprocessors, and the allocation of a specific set of fixed-size memory
slices.

In general, the exact capacity needed to instantiate a given MIG device is
defined by its MIG "profile". Multiple instances of a MIG profile can be
instantiated into concrete MIG devices if and only if enough resources are
available to accommodate it.

For example, the following table shows all of the MIG profiles available on an
NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU:

| Profile Name | Memory Size | Memory Slices | Multiprocessors | Copy Engines | Decoders | Encoders | JPEG Engines | OFA Engines |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|
|   7g.40gb    |   40192Mi   |       8       |       98        |      7       |    5     |    0     |      1       |      1      |
|   4g.20gb    |   19968Mi   |       4       |       56        |      4       |    2     |    0     |      0       |      0      |
|   3g.20gb    |   19968Mi   |       4       |       42        |      3       |    2     |    0     |      0       |      0      |
|   2g.10gb    |    9856Mi   |       2       |       28        |      2       |    1     |    0     |      0       |      0      |
|   1g.10gb    |    9856Mi   |       2       |       14        |      1       |    1     |    0     |      0       |      0      |
|  1g.5gb+me   |    4864Mi   |       1       |       14        |      1       |    1     |    0     |      1       |      1      |
|   1g.5gb     |    4864Mi   |       1       |       14        |      1       |    0     |    0     |      0       |      0      |

Zooming in on a single dimension (memory slices), the following diagram shows
the physical layout where multiple instances of each profile "could" be
instantiated (so long as enough resources are available to accommodate them).
Only those instances which do not overlap vertically can be allocated
simultaneously (because otherwise they would consume the same physical memory
slice). The X in some of the columns denotes slots where a particular profile
*could* fit in terms of consuming memory slices, but there are not enough of
the other required resources for that profile available to accommodate it.

+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
```

The most important thing to note from all of this is that partitioning a GPU
into a set of MIG devices is not as simple as slicing it up into a set of
fixed-size, non-overlapping partitions. Instead, one can think of a GPU as a
"bag" of resources that can be pulled together in a discrete set of ways to
construct a MIG device with a particular profile. When instatiating a MIG
device with a particular profile, the set of resources available to other MIG
devices (or the full GPU itself) gets depleted.

In other words, the allocation of one MIG device may nullify the
ability to allocate some subset of other possible MIG devices (but not all of
them). A MIG device is considered allocatable so long as the full GPU has
enough *unallocated* capacity to satisfy its capacity constraints across all
dimensions. If any single dimension is unavailable, that MIG device cannot be
allocated (but others might still be able to).

For example, the following `ResourceClaim` can be used to select a set of
non-overlapping MIG devices from a specific GPU.
```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: ResourceClaim
metadata:
  name: mig-devices
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: mig-1g-5gb-0
        deviceClassName: mig.nvidia.com
        selectors:
        - cel:
            expression: "device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].profile == '1g.5gb'"
      - name: mig-1g-5gb-1
        deviceClassName: mig.nvidia.com
        selectors:
        - cel:
            expression: "device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].profile == '1g.5gb'"
      - name: mig-2g-10gb
        deviceClassName: mig.nvidia.com
        selectors:
        - cel:
            expression: "device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].profile == '2g.10gb'"
      - name: mig-3g-20gb
        deviceClassName: mig.nvidia.com
        selectors:
        - cel:
            expression: "device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].profile == '3g.20gb'"
      constraints:
      - requests: []
        matchAttribute: "gpu.nvidia.com/parentUUID"
```

This would result in the following set of non-overlapping partitions:
```
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
| MemSlice 0 | MemSlice 1 | MemSlice 2 | MemSlice 3 | MemSlice 4 | Memslice 5 | MemSlice 6 | MemSlice 7 |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|                         X                         |                       3g.20gb                     |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|            X            |          2g.10gb        |            X            |            X            |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|   1g.5gb   |   1g.5gb   |     X      |     X      |     X      |     X      |     X      |     X      |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
```

Note that the YAML provided above is actually a *working* example for
allocating MIG devices with the NVIDIA DRA driver for GPUs in Kubernetes 1.31.
However, it requires that the MIG profiles being requested are pre-partitioned
on a GPU ahead of time.

In contrast, the extensions proposed in this KEP allow this partitioning to be
done *after* the scheduler has allocated these devices, keeping the GPU free to
be partitioned in different ways until the actual user-workload requesting them
has been submitted.

With his motivating example in mind. We define the following goals and
non-goals of this KEP.

### Goals

* Introduce the ability for "structured parameters" DRA to allocate both full
  devices and fixed-size partitions of full devices (across multiple
  dimensions). Both full devices and their valid set of partitions must be
  explicitly listed in a ResourceSlice for the scheduler to consider them for
  allocation.

* Keep the user-facing mechanism to request a full device or one of its
  partitions the same. In 1.31, it is already possible to select a device
  partition via a `Resourceclaim`, so long as the device vendor has
  pre-partitioned its devices and advertised them in a `ResourceSlice`. The
  user-facing mechanism to select these devices shouldn't change -- only the
  ability for the vendor to advertise "overlapping" partitions, such that the
  scheduler will never allocate conflicting ones at the same time.

* Provide abstractions to keep the overall footprint of a `ResourceSlice`
  small, such that all full devices (and their partitions) can be represented
  in a concise way.

### Non-Goals

* Allow a user to allocate arbitrarily-sized partitions of a device. In other
  words, only those partitions explicitly defined by a `ResourceSlice` will be
  allocatable by a user. Arbitrary slicing is out of scope for this KEP.

## Proposal

The basic idea is the following:

1. Introduce a new device type called `CompositeDevice` which has the same
   fields as a `BasicDevice`, plus two more. The first is a field called
   `Includes` and the second is a field called `ConsumesCapacityFrom`. Both
   full devices and their partitions are represented as instances of this new
   `CompositeDevice` type and are listed right next to one another in the
   top-level `Devices` list of a `ResourceSlice`.

1. The `Includes` field serves to reference a set of "mixins" that a
   `CompositeDevice` can reference to extend the set of attributes and
   capacities it defines explicitly. The goal being to reduce the overall
   footprint of each device when a common set of attributes and capacities can
   be applied. The mixins themselves are introduced as a list of top-level
   objects directly next to the list of `Devices` inside a `ResourceSlice`.
   They are not allocatable on their own. Entries in the `Includes` list can
   only reference mixins in the same `ResourceSlice`. References to
   mixins in other ResourceSlices are not allowed.

1. The `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field contains a list of *other* devices where the
   capacity of the current device should be consumed if the scheduler decides
   to allocate it. For the first version of this feature, only a single entry
   is allowed in this list. An entry in the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` list 
   essentially removes that capacity from any referenced devices,
   rendering them unallocatable on their own. Only devices in the same
   `ResourceSlice` can be referenced in the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` list.
   References to devices in other ResourceSlices are not allowed.

With these additions in place, the scheduler has everything it needs to support
the dynamic allocation of both full devices and their (possibly overlapping)
fixed-size partitions. That is to say, the scheduler now has the ability to
"flatten" all devices by applying any mixins from their `Includes` fields as
well as track any capacities consumed from one device by another through its
`ConsumesCapacityFrom` field. More details on the actual algorithm the
scheduler follows to make allocation decisions based on the
`ConsumesCapacityFrom` field can be found in the Design Details section below.

## Design Details

The exact set of proposed API changes can be seen below:
```go
// ResourceSliceSpec contains the information published by the driver in one ResourceSlice.
type ResourceSliceSpec struct {
	...

	// DeviceMixins represents a list of device mixins, i.e. a collection of
	// shared attributes and capacities that an actual device can "include"
	// to extend the set of attributes and capacities it already defines.

type DeviceRef struct {
	// Name refers to the name of a device in the pool.
	//
	// +required
	Name string `json:"name"`
}
```

As mentioned previously, the main features being added here are (1) the ability
to include a set of mixins in a device definition, and (2) the ability to
express that capacity from one device gets consumed by another device if/when
the scheduler decides to allocate it.

To simplify the conversation, we discuss each new feature separately, starting
with "mixins" and the new `Includes` field, which allows a set of mixins to
extend a device with common attributes and capacities.

### Extending a device with as set of mixins

A simple example the defines a set of mixins and includes them in the
definition of 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs can be seen below:

```yaml

As you can see, three mixins are created called "system-attributes",
"common-gpu-attributes", and "common-gpu-capacities", which all get included in
the definitons of the actual GPU devices themselves, along with their own
device-specific attributes (and device-specific capacities if there were any).

With this in place, the scheduler can parse these device definitions and
"flatten" them into something that looks exactly the same as a `Basic` device.
The scheduler can then allocate such devices using the same algorithm it uses
for `Basic` devices.

### Defining device partitions in terms of consumed capacity in a composite device

A simple example demonstrating how the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field can be used
to define multiple, allocatable partitions of a single overarching device can be
seen below.

```yaml
devices:
- name: gpu-0
  composite:
    capacity:
      memory:
        quantity: 40Gi
- name: gpu-0-partition-0
  composite:
    capacity:
      memory:
        quantity: 10Gi
    consumesCapacityFrom:
    - name: gpu-0
- name: gpu-0-partition-1
  composite:
    capacity:
      memory:
        quantity: 10Gi
    consumesCapacityFrom:
    - name: gpu-0
- name: gpu-0-partition-2
  composite:
    capacity:
      memory:
        quantity: 10Gi
    consumesCapacityFrom:
    - name: gpu-0
- name: gpu-0-partition-3
  composite:
    capacity:
      memory:
        quantity: 10Gi
    consumesCapacityFrom:
    - name: gpu-0
```

In this example, five devices are defined: a full GPU called "gpu-0" and four
partitions of "gpu-0" called "gpu-0-partion-0", "gpu-0-partion-1",
"gpu-0-partion-2", and "gpu-0-partion-3" respectively. The full GPU has 40Gi of
memory available, and each of the partitions pull 10Gi from it.

In general, the way to interpret each of these device definitions is as
follows:

  * A device which *does not* have a `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field is assumed to
    be a "source" of capacity from which other devices can pull when they are
    being allocated.

  * A device which *does* have a `ConsumesCapacityField` is assumed to be a
    "sink" of capacity, pulling from "source" devices in order to satisfy its
    own capacity when allocated.

The scheduler must track the availability of the "source" device, and
pull from it whenever it decides to allocate a "sink" device.

So long as no other devices have been allocated that reference a given "source"
device in their `ConsumesCapacityField`, it is free to be allocated by the
scheduler. However, as soon as its capacity has been pulled down by any given
"sink" device, it can no longer be allocated until its capacity is freed again.

Likewise, a "sink" device can be allocated if it's "source" device is available.

The devices can be nested, meaning that the same device might be a sink for
one device and a source for another device. No cycles is allowed, so the
final device in a chain formed by the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` fields must
always be a "source" device.

Since the number of entries in the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` list will currently
be constrained to one, it means a single "sink" device can only pull capacity
from a single "source" device. In practice this means that the hiararchy of
"sink" devices under a single "source" device must always form a tree.

During the allocation process, it will no longer be sufficient for the scheduler
to just check if a device itself is allocated. For a device to be allocatable, the
following has to be true:
* All "source" devices from the current device to the root of the tree by following
  the entries in the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field, must be allocatable.
* All "sink" devices in the subtree underneath the current devices must be
  allocatable.

In other words, the scheduler needs to make sure that no resources that are a
partition of the current one is already allocated, and that any resources of
which the current device is a partition has been allocated.

This is pretty straightforward to implement, simply by traversing the subtree
under the current device and then walking the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` references
up to the final "source" device.

Since the `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field is a list, we can allow more than one
"source" device in the future. However, that is more complicated both to
implement and for users to understand. Whether it will happen depends on
whether there are compelling use-cases and the priority of supporting those.

### Putting it all together for the MIG use-case

The example in the previous section only lists a **single** "memory" capacity
on "gpu-0" that gets divided evenly across 4 possible sub-partitions. While
this simple use case is certainly supported, it is not representative of the
more complex use-cases we envision the extensions in this KEP to be used for.
Specifically, for partitioning devices across multiple dimensions, such as is
necessary to support the MIG use-case for NVIDIA GPUs described previously.

With MIG, one can think of a GPU as a "bag" of resources that can be pulled
together in a discrete set of ways to construct a MIG device with a particular
"profile". These resources include things like "memory", "number of JPEG
engines", "discrete memory slices on the physical GPU die", etc.

Using the idea of "sink" and "source" devices, we can construct a full GPU as a
"source" device with a set of capacities representing the different resources
in its "bag" of resources. Each MIG device then becomes a "sink" device listing
out the capacities it requires to build out its specific "profile" and then
referencing the full GPU it is attached to in its `ConsumesCapacityFrom` field.

For example, an unrolled "source" device for an NVIDIA A100 GPU looks as follows:
```yaml
- name: gpu-0
  composite:
    attributes:
      ...
    capacity:
      copy-engines:
        quantity: "7"
      decoders:
        quantity: "5"
      encoders:
        quantity: "0"
      jpeg-engines:
        quantity: "1"
      memory:
        quantity: 40Gi
      memorySlice0:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice1:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice2:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice3:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice4:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice5:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice6:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice7:
        quantity: "1"
      multiprocessors:
        quantity: "98"
      ofa-engines:
        quantity: "1"
```

With three example "sink" devices representing MIG partitions defined as follows:
```yaml
- name: gpu-0-mig-1g.5gb-0
  composite:
    attributes:
      ...
    capacity:
      copy-engines:

      memory:

      memorySlice0:
        quantity: "1"
      multiprocessors:
        quantity: "14"
      ofa-engines:
        quantity: "0"

  composite:
    attributes:
      ...
    capacity:
      copy-engines:
        quantity: "2"
      decoders:
        quantity: "1"
      encoders:
        quantity: "0"
      jpeg-engines:
        quantity: "0"
      memory:
        quantity: 9856Mi
      memorySlice0:
        quantity: "1"
      memorySlice1:
        quantity: "1"
      multiprocessors:
        quantity: "28"
      ofa-engines:
        quantity: "0"
    consumesCapacityFrom:
    - name: gpu-0
```

The first two MIG devices can be allocated together because there is enough
capacity across all dimensions in the full GPU's capacity to satisfy both of
them simultaneously. However, neither of the first two MIG devices can be
allocated together with the third one because they compete on the capacity
available in the full GPU across its "memorySlice0" and "memorySlice1"
dimensions respectively.

A comprehensive example of the actual MIG partitions that would be created for
a 2 GPU DGXA100 server that ties together the concepts of both mixins and
`ConsumesCapacityFrom` can be seen below.

One can imagine how this would be extended for larger servers with more GPUs,
by simply adding new devices with references to the proper mixins and filling
out their `ConsumesCapacityFrom` fields appropriately.

### Test Plan

<!--
[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`
-->

Start of v1.32 development cycle (v1.32.0-alpha.1-178-gd9c46d8ecb1):

- `k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/cel`: 88.8%
- `k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/structured`: 82.7%
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/controller/resourceclaim`: 70.0%
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/dynamicresources`: 72.9%

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

The existing [integration tests for kube-scheduler which measure
performance](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/integration/scheduler_perf#readme)
will be extended to cover the overheaad of running the additional logic to
support the features in this KEP. These also serve as [correctness
tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/cecebe8ea2feee856bc7a62f4c16711ee8a5f5d9)
as part of the normal Kubernetes "integration" jobs which cover [the dynamic
resource
controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/294bde0079a0d56099cf8b8cf558e3ae7230de12/test/integration/scheduler_perf/util.go#L135-L139).

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.

End-to-end testing depends on a working resource driver and a container runtime
with CDI support. A [test
driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/e2e/dra/test-driver)
was developed as part of the overall DRA development effort. We will extend
this test driver to enable support for `PartitonableDevice`s and add tests to
ensure they are handled by the scheduler as described in this KEP.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- 3 examples of vendors making use of the extensions proposed in this KEP
- Scalability tests that mirror real-world usage as determined by user feedback
- Allowing time for feedback

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The usual Kubernetes upgrade and downgrade strategy applies for in-tree
components. Vendors must take care that upgrades and downgrades work with the
drivers that they provide to customers.

### Version Skew Strategy

All of the API extensions proposed in this KEP are embedded under a new
`CompositeDevice` type which is a one-of inside of the existing `Device`
type. Since all API extensions are embedded in this way, there is no risk for
version skew downgrades because these devices will never have existed in older
clusters. For upgrades, we will need to be sure not to directly extend this new
device type with new fields, but rather introduce a new one-of if more /
alternate functionality is needed in the future.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: DRAPartitionableDevices
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver
    - kube-scheduler

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Applications that were already deployed and are running will continue to
work. They will also continue to work when restarted because the CDI devices that
have been prepared for them won't change across the restart.

The DRA driver itself should also be able to survive a rollback, so long as it
has been written to advertise any partitions as "pre-partitioned" devices. It
will just lose the ability to set up new partitions dynamically.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The scheduler may lose track of what devices it has allocated to what pods. Any
pods that had previously allocated devices with the feature enabled will need
to be deleted to ensure they are freed back to their corresponding driver  and
the accounting for them is updated in the scheduler.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Objects with the API additions introduced in the KEP are never written by
Kubernetes components themselves. They are written by 3rd-party drivers.
However, the scheduler does consume these objects and track information from
them in order to make scheduling decisions.

Unit tests in will be written in the scheduler to verify that enabling /
disabling of the DRAPartitionableDevices feature gate is non-disruptive to the
scheduler.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.

- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field:

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the followingâ€”thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Scalability

No. The API extensions in this KEP are limited to the existing `ResourceSlice`
object, with no additional requirements to consume this object by additional
components.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No. The this KEP proposes extensions to an existing type, but not a new type itself.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

Yes and No. With the extensions proposed in this KEP, individual
`ResourceSlices` have additional fields available to them, thus increasing
their overall signature. However, the purpose of the new `Mixins` abstraction
is to actually *reduce* the footprint of these objects, not increase them. As
such, we expect the size of thes eobjects to actually decrease, not increase,
but it is ultimately up to how 3rd party vendors decide to use them.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

Yes. The time to allocate a device to a claim (and thus schedule the first pod
that references that claim) will be affected.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Will be considered for beta.

## Implementation History

- Kubernetes 1.32: KEP accepted as "implementable".

## Drawbacks

It adds complexity to the scheduler.

## Alternatives

Many different approaches were considered, but all of them were either *too*
flexible (e.g. adding a DSL within the embedded YAML to construct a set of
devices) or too rigid (e.g. would not be easily extendible to support
multiple-levels of partitioning). The proposal we ultimately landed on is a
nice balance between the two.

Specifically, the following seven alternative proposals were considered:

**Option 1:** Top-level, single "bag" of resources with no mixins

This approach is similar to what is described in this KEP, except that all
shared resources are provided via a single abstract "bag" of resources rather
than being attached to any particular device. Additionally, there was no notion
of a mixin to help reduce the footprint of a ResourceSlice, but this is
somewhat orthogonal to the proposals ability to support partitionable devices.

This approach was ultimately discarded for four reasons. First, having an
abstract "bag" of resources not tied to any particular device was perceived
as non-intuitive since the resources actually ARE tied to some physical device
that can be allocated. Second, having just a single "bag" of resources meant
that every resource in that bag needed to be prefaced with some notion of the
device that would ultimately be pulling form it. This was overly verbose and
error prone. Third, there was no support for nested partitioning,
which is necessary for supporting the two-level partitioning scheme that MIG
provides, as well as for supporting SRIOV devices. Fourth, there is no ability
to share attributes across devices like we have in this KEP using mixins.

**Option 2:** Top-level, multiple "bags" of resources with no mixins

This approach is similar to option 1, except that multiple, named resource
groups could be created, from which different devices could pull their
resources. This change made it so that each "bag" of resources could be tied to
a particular device (and its partitions) without needing to embed the name of
the device on the resource name itself. This made for a more compact
representation as well as reference to resources from a device.

This approach was rejected for similar reasons as option 1: i.e. having an
abstract "bag" of resources not tied to any particular device was perceived as
non-intuitive and there is no support for nested partitioning or sharing of
attributes.

**Option 3:** Top-level, multiple "bags" of resources with shared attributes

This option is identical to option 2 except that we introduced an abstraction
similar to the mixins described in this KEP. This change allowed us to overcome
1 of the 4 reasons to reject this option, but the other 3 were still valid.

**Option 4:** Top-level, "DeviceShape" defining common capacities and resources for a device

This option is similar to option 3 except that it combines the shared resources
of a device and its common attributes into a top-level abstraction called a
"DeviceShape". As part of this, a "DeviceShape" would explicitly define what
partitions could exist for such a device (without needing to explicitly list
them out in a ResoruceSlice itself). Actual device instances in the
ResourceSlice would then reference a given DeviceShape to define both its own
device as well as any of its partitions.

This approach was ultimately rejected because it was not flexible enough to
express the fact that every device (and its partitions) need some number of
device specific attributes. It also didn't allow for nested partitions or the
ability to create devices that are the "combination" of resources from more
than one source.

All of that said, these "DeviceShapes" paved the way for the mixin idea that is
included in this KEP.

**Option 5:** Top-level, "DeviceShape" with DSL to fill in common capacities and resources for a devic

This option is similar to option 4 except that it generalized the construction
of a device in terms of its "DeviceShape" by introducing a DSL templating
language to "fill in" any device specific attributes when referenced.

This approach was ultimately rejected because of the complexity of maintaining
/ understanding such a templating language embedded in the YAML. It also still
didn't allow nested partitions because of the way the "DeviceShapes" were
constructed.

**Option 6:** Top-level, "PartitionTemplates" defining common capacities and resources for a device or its partitions

This approach is similar to option 4 except that there is not a single device
shape with embedded partitions. Instead top-level devices and their partitions
could each be defined in terms of a "PartitionTemplate" that would be
referenced by a specific device when instantiated. This is essentially what has
now become mixins, with the exception that this option allowed one
"PartitionTemplate" to extend another "PartitionTemplate" whereas mixins must
be standalone. An earlier iteration of mixins also had this "inherit"
capability, but it made the ResourceSlice less readable since you had to
back-track recursively through all such mixins to figure out exactly what set
of attributes/capacities were being added to a device.

This approach was not outright "rejected", but rather has morphed into what is
now being proposed in this KEP, just with different names for the various
abstractions.

**Option 7:**

This approach is essentially option 6, but with all "common" mixins pushed out
to their own object rather than included in each ResoureSlice. This seems
logical to do on the surface, however it becomes complicated when you start to
think about which component owns the life-cycle of these shared objects (and
what happens if they are missing). Its not something we have completely
ruled-out as a future enhancement since without them there is ALOT of redudant
information repeated in each ResourceSlice. However, it is out of scope of the
current KEP and may be considered in a later one.

discussed above:
